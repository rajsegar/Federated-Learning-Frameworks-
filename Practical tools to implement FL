Practical tools to implement FL: 
•	TensorFlow Federated (TFF) 
•	PySyft (OpenMined) 
•	Flower (FLWR) 
•	FATE (Federated AI Technology Enabler) 

Design and Setup 
Design System Architecture 
•	Choose a suitable FL framework (e.g., Flower for simulation or FATE for enterprise). 
•	Define roles: clients, server(s), aggregators. 
•	Identify communication protocols (e.g., gRPC, HTTP, custom). 

•	Clients: ≥3 virtual machines AWS environment
o	EDR logs 
o	New model vs existing FL model 
•	Server: 1+ virtual machine 
•	Protocols: Implement Bonawitz et al.'s Secure Aggregation (2017) 
•	Attacks Simulated: Based on Gupta et al. (2022) — claim current secure aggregation gives false security
